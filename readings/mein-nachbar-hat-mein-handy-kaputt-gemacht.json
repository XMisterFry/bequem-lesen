  "translation": "My neighbor broke my phone. I am very sad. The phone was new. The boy is five years old. He often plays outside. Yesterday he played with a ball. Suddenly the ball hit my phone. It fell to the ground. Now the screen is broken. I called his mother. She was very nice. We talked about the problem. She said she will help. Maybe I can get a new phone. I hope it goes quickly."
