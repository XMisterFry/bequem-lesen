  "translation": "Peter has a stomachache today. His belly hurts, so he goes to the doctor. In the morning, Peter sees both of his acquaintances at his house. He talks with the official and his friend Martin. At the doctor, the official says that being healthy is important. The doctor asks Peter if his leg also hurts. Peter points to his leg and says no. In the waiting room, the doctor gives, for example, advice. 'Fruit is healthy,' he says, 'and walking is also good.' Martin is well known in the village because he helps many people. Everyone greets the acquaintance in the park under the tree. Peter goes home and feels better."
